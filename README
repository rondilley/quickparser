=== QuickParser (quickparser)

== What is QuickParser?

QuickParser is a fast, non-regex log parser.  The first
version includes a default template for Juniper (Netscreen)
stype key=value logs.  I will release the full version with
configurable templates some time in the future if my
co-conspiritor does not get the lead out and get his version
done and released.  By fast I am talking 2.6M lines per
minute on a single processor 2.5GHz PC running linux and 950K
lines per minute on a SunBlade 2000 with 1GHz processors.

The output is pseudo-XML.  As my partner in crime describes
it, the format is enough like XML to piss off the XML haters
and far enough from the standard to piss off the XML lovers.

== Why use it?

Quick parser is a handy tool to normalize firewall logs.  We
use it to push logs into an analysis tool called overwatch.
It is really fast, which makes all the difference in the world
when you are pushing days and weeks of logs into your data
analysis tools.

== Implimentation

To use Quick Parser pass your log data filename as an
argument to quickparser and pipe the output to a file or
let it all stream to standard out.  Here is an example of
the output:

<rec>
<time>Aug 31 01:00:22</time>
<NetScreen device_id>sec2-fw</NetScreen device_id>
<Root>system-notification-00257</Root>
<start_time>"2007-08-31 07:00:22"</start_time>
<duration>0</duration>
<policy_id>873861</policy_id>
<service>NETBIOS</service>
<proto>17</proto>
<src zone>Untrust</src zone>
<dst zone>DMZ1</dst zone>
<action>Deny</action>
<sent>0</sent>
<rcvd>0</rcvd>
<src>172.10.10.10</src>
<dst>10.10.10.10</dst>
<src_port>35775</src_port>
<dst_port>137</dst_port>
<session_id>0</session_id>
</rec>

== Security Implications

Assume that there are errors in the psmd source that
would allow a specially crafted packet to allow an attacker
to exploit psmd to gain access to the computer that psmd is
running on!!!  psmd tries to get rid of priviledges it does
not need and can run in a chroot environment.  I recommend
that you use the chroot and uid/gid options.  They are there
to compensate for my poor programming skills.  Don't trust
this software and install and use is at your own risk.

== Bugs

I am not a programmer by any strech of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
